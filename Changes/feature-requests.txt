F3 - Adapt the design for mobile screens
F4 - Make a pop-up modal for the record-deletion confirmation.

[Done] F7 - Enable search functionality
F8 - Enable filtering functionality
F9 - Enable sorting functionality

COSMETIC
C1 - Animate the bottom border of active/focused input fields. Make the line expand outwards from the center.
C2 - add some color variation to the logo in the top left.
C3 - Add a subtle dorp shadow below the filter pane, helping to visually separate it from the content.
C4 - The date-input fields in the filter pane are too long in width and eppear weird and off-center. Figure out a way to fix that.
C5 - The date-input fields in the filter pane should have bolder text when not empty.
C6 - Have the borders of adjacent records appear united, with only the top and bottom corners of the entire list - rounded. When a row is "active" and divides the list in 2 by spacing itself out from the rest, then there will be two individual groups with that style - above the active row and below it.
C7 - Add a very subtle gradient to the background of the record-container.
C8 - Add a very subtle gradient to the background of the header.
